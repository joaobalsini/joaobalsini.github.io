              "As a product owner in Asolvi, I have had the pleasure to work with Joao Gilbert Balsini Moura. Joao is
              the one that the other team members turn to for advice, he is very skilled and shows a very good
              understanding of the business and how to translate this into the product they are creating. He works
              methodically and structured and playes a key role into creating such a collaborative spirit in the team.
              He also brought a very easy-going social attitude to the team, which I think is key to create a good
              working environment."

              "Joao is always there if you need a hand. Despite being far away and in a different time zone, he shows up
              when he is needed the most and always with a positive attitude. He has a way of identifying tasks that are
              neglected by the team, for example if we fall behind on code reviews, leading to consistency in the work
              we do and how we do it."
