          Successfully replaced Excel, used to manage parts of the company, with a modern ERP system that I
          developed using Ruby on Rails, Javascript and MySQL. That system:<br /><br />
          - Improved a lot how the company worked, allowing staff to do a lot more, with more quality, in less
          time.<br /><br />
          - Made new data available in real time to managers to better understand the company through
          reports.<br /><br />
          - Developed an easy way to create new fast budgets to help planning and check viability of projects by
          enabling a way to reuse old budgets with a click.<br /><br />
          - Developed an easy way to create and register contracts with customers by automatically generating word
          documents through this new system. In a single step we were able to add contracts data to the system and
          create the document. <br /><br />
          - Created a way to manage costumers contracts that easily recalculates payments based on contract data and
          warns staff to check the ones in debt.<br /><br />
          - Sucesfully created a way of checking construction revenues by combining contracts, budgets, planning and
          real expenses/incomes information.<br /><br />
          - Created an easy way to manage contractors, by registering production done by them, what has been paid,
          the values to be paid and easy reports.<br /><br />
          - Helped managing employees, managing absenses, vacations, extra working hours, tracking cash loans and
          other possible discounts and creating reports to accountants.<br />
