        <p class="description is-size-6-desktop is-size-7-mobile">- Successfully managed a real state and
          construction company with around 50 employees and contractors. The conflicts were reduced by a big margin
          at the same time the ownership of tasks was improved. <br /><br />
          - Successfully migrated new company projects from CAD to BIM, that change made our projects a lot easier
          to track, increased the quality of the construction, reduced maintenance and as a consequence, increased
          our revenue.<br /><br />
          - Managed the construction of two buildings around 10.000 m2 from foundation to deliver.<br /><br />
          - Defined, together with an external marketing team, a team of architects and engineers, and real state
          agents, two of the new products of the company: chosen where to build, the construction techniques to be
          used and the design of the product. After I worked on the budget, the planning and how to best sell those
          products. We sold almost 50% of the units during the first release phase.<br /><br />
          - Successfully updated current construction techniques to reduce future maintenance costs.<br /><br />
          - Updated some of the company processes through the use of existing software or developing new modules on
          the existing Ruby system.<br /><br />
          - Hired and trained two new engineers that replaced part of my functions when I left.
